This is my personal website. I aimed for something simple, almost like a business card. I think Jaime Teevan's website (http://teevan.org/) is an excellent example of a personal site, so I drew a lot of inspiration from hers.

The site is hosted using GitHub pages and a custom domain (carsonshaffer.me).

I plan on updating this site infrequently.
